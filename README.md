pedeps
======

Cross-platform C library to read data from PE/PE+ files (the format of Windows .exe and .dll files).

Description
-----------

The pedeps C library provides functions to retrieve data from Windows .exe and .dll files.

These files are in either PE (Windows 32-bit) or PE+ (Windows 64-bit) format, which are extensions of the COFF format.

Currently the library allows iterating through:
- exported symbols
- imported symbols from dependency .dll files

Goal
----
The library was written with the following goals in mind:
- written in standard C, but allows being used by C++
- hiding the complexity of the file format
- portable across different platforms (Windows, macOS, *nix)
- no dependencies

Libraries
---------

The following libraries are provided:
- `-lpedeps` - requires `#include <pedeps.h>` (and optionally `#include <pestructs.h>`)

Command line utilities
----------------------
Some command line utilities are included:
- `listpedeps` - show information and list imported and exported symbols
- `copypedeps` - copy file(s) to a folder along with all dependency files

Dependencies
------------
The library has no depencancies.

The utilities have the following dependency:
- [libavl](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libavl-dev) (only for copypedeps)

Building from source
--------------------
### Requirements:
- a C compiler like gcc or clang, on Windows MinGW and MinGW-w64 are supported
- a Linux/Unix shell environment (like bash, which is also present on macOS), on Windows MSYS is supported
- the make command

### Building
- To build run: `make`
- To install run: `make install`
- To install to a specific folder run: `make install PREFIX=/usr/local`

### Microsoft Visual C++
- Building from source using MSVC is not supported. However, binary downloads are available for Windows (both 32-bit and 64-bit). They include a .def file that can be used to generate the .lib file with the following commands (run from a prompt inside the lib folder of the extracted binary package):
  + for Windows 32-bit: `lib /def:pedeps.def /out:pedeps.lib /machine:X86`
  + for Windows 64-bit: `lib /def:pedeps.def /out:pedeps.lib /machine:X64`
